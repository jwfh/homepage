#### NL Regional Science Fair Bronze Medal, 2015

A statistical analysis of training techniques used in competitive swimming, entitled _Is Tapering Effective?_, to satisfy the Internal Assessment requirement for the International Baccalaureate SL Mathematics certificate.

I then, with permission, entered this report into the schoolwide science fair where it ranked among the top projects and was chosen to move on to the Regional Science Fair. Here I won a bronze medal and was congratulated for the level of statistical analysis performed in the report.

The paper is available in PDF format with my other [publications](/publications/).
