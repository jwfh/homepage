# About

In 2015, I first touched web development with a small Wordpress site at [jwfh.ca](https://jwfh.ca) that I hosted on a VPS &mdash; web server and database management done by yours truly. At this point the site's focus was as a blog. I wanted some way to share various things I had learned through self-teaching. Many posts were of a tutorial nature. I wrote about managing enterprise Windows deployments &mdash; often with a focus on security &mdash; as this is where my interests primarily were at the time.

In 2017, I unpublished the blog as it had become neglected as interests changed and academic life in post-secondary required a more significant time committment.

In early 2018 I reclaimed [jwfh.ca](https://jwfh.ca) as my personal website, this time with the focus being on self-promotion in the form of a résumé and digital design portfolio. I used Adobe Muse to generate a static site for a short while. Adobe discontinuing Muse led me to the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) static site generator. While [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) had potential, I felt that it wasn't for me. I think it is possible that I was using it not as its creators intended and as such was working against it instead of with it.

Since then, Memorial's COMP-3100 course provided me with an opportunity learn a new web development technology for the term project. I chose to go above and beyond by convincing my group to use a technology outside the scope of the course: the [React](https://reactjs.org/) framework.

In its fourth iteration now, [jwfh.ca](https://jwfh.ca) is a static site that uses the [React](https://reactjs.org/) static site framework known as [Gasby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). [jwfh.ca](https://jwfh.ca)'s current state has combined both of its previous goals to provide a showcase of my skills and achievements, as well as a blog in which I can write about things I find interesting.

The site's current design I adopted from the Colorlib [Niko](https://colorlib.com/wp/template/niko/) template which was written in plain HTML, jQuery, and CSS, and released under a CC BY 3.0 license. In an effort to make the site more manageable, I rewrote much of the code to be compliant with the [React](https://reactjs.org/) way of doing things and I moved all static content to central JavaScript file so that others may be able to fork the site and personalize _all_ content from one place. Of course design aspects may be changed by diving deeper into the source. Much of the CSS is nearly unchanged. I've used Markdown for the blog part of the site and let [Gasby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)'s GraphQL engine do the heavy lifting in linking between posts and linking the home page to recent posts.
